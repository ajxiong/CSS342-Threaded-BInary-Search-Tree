# CSS342-Threaded-Binary-Search-Tree

This is the final group project for winter quarter 2021 of CSS342 taught by Afra Mashhadi at the University of Washington Bothell. The final group project consists
of a threaded binary search tree, and connects any leafs to its in-order predecessor to create a faster and more efficient in-order traversal.
